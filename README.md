Running the Angular 6 Login Tutorial Example Locally
The tutorial example uses Webpack 4.8 to transpile the TypeScript code and bundle the Angular 6 modules together, and the webpack dev server is used as the local web server, to learn more about using webpack with TypeScript you can check out the webpack docs.

Install NodeJS and NPM from https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
Download or clone the tutorial project source code from https://github.com/cornflourblue/angular-6-registration-login-example
Install all required npm packages by running npm install from the command line in the project root folder (where the package.json is located).
Start the application by running npm start from the command line in the project root folder.
Your browser should automatically open at http://localhost:8080 with the demo Angular 6 login page displayed.

Running the Angular CLI Version of the Tutorial Example Locally
This version of the tutorial example is pretty much the same as the Webpack version above, I've just copied it into the project structure generated by Angular CLI (6.0.8) to make it easier for anybody that's using Angular CLI.
